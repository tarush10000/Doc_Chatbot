# Doccy

This project is a chatbot application built with PyQt6 that processes documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX), generates embeddings, and answers questions based on the content of those documents. It uses ChromaDB for storing embeddings, Google's Generative AI for generating responses, and edge-tts for text-to-speech functionality.

## Features

- Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.
- Generates embeddings using the `SentenceTransformer` model.
- Stores and queries embeddings with ChromaDB.
- Ranks documents based on query relevance using a `CrossEncoder` model.
- Generates answers using Google's Generative AI.
- Reads responses aloud using text-to-speech (TTS).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tarush10000/Doc_Chatbot.git
    cd Doc_Chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your API key for Google's Generative AI by setting an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export Gemini_API="your_google_generative_ai_api_key"
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX) in the `documents` folder.

2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Once document processing is complete, you can enter queries in the input field and receive responses based on the content of your documents.

4. The chatbot interface also supports text-to-speech as it reads out the responses generated by the Gemini model using Edge_TTS.
   
## File Structure
